# Features
For any given word or phrase, it will be able to represent that input data in its HTML color form

# How to Run
The existing application is run from command line now. The future plan is to develop a Graphical User Interface where users can input a word or a phrase.
Now, once the user inputs the following command, the application is going to download images for all the phrases in a previously stored data file and estimate colors for those phrases and save them in another file.

# Sample Usage Code
To run the application-
```
python3 color_mapping_main.py
```

To run the tests-
```
pytest image_processor_test.py
pytest stat_calculator_test.py
```
